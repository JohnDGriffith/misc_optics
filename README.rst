  Miscellaneous optical classes and functions
  ===========================================
  
  This project contains two classes and several functions.  You can use the
  Blackbody class for radiometric and photometric calculations on blackbody
  radiators.  You can use the MBeam class for paraxial beam traces.  It supports
  M = 1 for TEM00 mode and M > 1 for mixed mode beams.  There are also a few
  functions for converting beam sizes and computing the performance of
  diffraction limited lenses.
